# Solana Token Creator

Primary goal of this repo is to help to experiment with solana token creation process without diving too much into details.

Tried to make it as intuitive as possible since there is so much nuances compared to EVM blockchains.

Project is built on top of [solana dapp template](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold), all instructions to run project locally can be found there. Inspired by
[token creator](https://github.com/jacobcreech/Token-Creator) by Jacob.

App is deployed on vercel. [Link](https://solana-token-creator.vercel.app/).
